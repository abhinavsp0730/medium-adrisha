The below post is a list of 10 current ‚Äò**life lessons‚Äô publications on Medium**, with different (*hopefully useful!*) stats and information about them. I‚Äôve collected the number of subscribers, 5 associated tags to use, and the methods to apply to be published along with contact information.

I sorted through **41** different life lessons publications on Medium so that you don‚Äôt have to! This list is to help fellow **noob writers** out there on Medium that are interested in publishing in the broad topic of writing.

## Some quick notes

 1. These aren‚Äôt the top 10 life lessons publications, **I‚Äôve curated them** from the top 41 life lessons publications on Medium

 2. I‚Äôve arranged the below from most to least amount of subscribers (in theory, the **hardest to easiest** to get published in)

 3. I‚Äôve tried my best to curate ones that **still accept writers**

 4. I‚Äôve excluded publications that have **stopped publishing **(many of the 41 I searched through)

 5. I‚Äôve **excluded Medium owned **publications

 6. I‚Äôve tried to **exclude big existing magazine**s that I know of (ex. The Economist)

 7. Most publications require **unpublished drafts**
